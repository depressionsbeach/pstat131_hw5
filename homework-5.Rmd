## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

```{r}
pokemon <- read.csv('data/Pokemon.csv')
```


### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('janitor')
install.packages('glmnet')
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(janitor)
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
library(glmnet)
library(corrplot)
tidymodels_prefer()
```

```{r}
pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)
head(pokemon)
```

<br />
**clean_names() cleaned the variable names into a standard format (lowercase snake format). It is useful because it saves the hassle of constantly checking if variable names are entered correctly in the code, and eliminates the possibility of unusual variable names interfering with the syntax of the code.**

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
pokemon %>%
  ggplot(aes(type_1)) +
  geom_bar()
```

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?
<br />
**There are 18 classes of outcome. Classes like ** *Fairy * **and ** *Flying * **are rarer than others.** 

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% filter(type_1 %in% c('Bug', 'Fire', 'Grass', 'Normal','Water', 'Psychic'))
pokemon$type_1 <- factor(pokemon$type_1)
pokemon$legendary <- factor(pokemon$legendary)
head(pokemon)
```
<br />
**We can see it has been successfully filtered and factorised.**

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

```{r}
set.seed(1729)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.75, strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
```
<br />
**If the strata is performed correctly, the first value should be 0 and the second value should be close to 3.**
```{r}
nrow(pokemon_train) + nrow(pokemon_test) - nrow(pokemon)
nrow(pokemon_train)/nrow(pokemon_test)
```
Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
pokemon_folds <- pokemon_train %>%
  vfold_cv(strata = type_1, v=5)
```

<br />
**We use stratified sampling to maintain a similar class ratio throughout the K folds and the entire training set. Furthermore, since the initial train/test split is also stratified, the class ratio in each fold should be similar to that of the entire data set.**

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- pokemon_train %>%
  recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + sp_def + attack + defense + speed + hp) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_dummy(c(legendary, generation))
```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

```{r}
pokemon_model <- 
  multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>%
  set_mode('classification') %>%
  set_engine('glmnet')

pokemon_wkflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe) %>%
  add_model(pokemon_model)

comb_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0, 1)), levels = c(penalty = 10, mixture = 10))
```

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?
<br />
**This question is a bit confusing. Since there are 10 levels for the penalty parameter and 10 levels for the mixing parameter, we should feed  100 different models to the training set. However, considering that we split the training set into 5 folds, there should be 500 models that are actually fitted.**

### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  pokemon_wkflow,
  resamples = pokemon_folds,
  grid = comb_grid
)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#save(tune_res, file = 'tune_res.rda')
load(file = 'tune_res.rda')
```

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```
<br />
**It seems that smaller ** *penalty * **tends to produce better results, though not strictly so. The pattern for ** *mixture * **values is unclear. For instance, the smallest value of ** *mixture * **produces the highest accuracy, but it is followed by a rather large value.**


### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
best_model <- select_best(tune_res, metric = 'roc_auc')
best_model
```
```{r}
pokemon_final <- finalize_workflow(pokemon_wkflow, best_model)
pokemon_final_fit <- fit(data = pokemon_train, pokemon_final)
augment(pokemon_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)
```
<br />
**Evaluation: pretty inaccurate, though better than a random guess.**

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

```{r}
augment(pokemon_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_auc(truth=type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
  
```
<br />
**The overall ROC_AUC is 0.721.**

Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

<br />
**ROC curves:   **
```{r, echo=FALSE}
augment(pokemon_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(truth=type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>%
  autoplot()
```

<br />
**Heat map:  **
```{r,echo=FALSE}
augment(pokemon_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = 'heatmap')
```

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

**I noticed that the model works like crap. It is best at predicting ** *Normal * **types, and it's worst at predicting ** *Fire * **types. (literally 0 percent correct!) Overall, when the type is not ** *Normal * **, the model tends to predict it as a ** *Water * **type.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pokemon_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1, y = attack)) +
  geom_boxplot()
pokemon_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1, y = defense)) +
  geom_boxplot()
pokemon_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1, y = hp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
pokemon_train %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1, y = speed)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


<br />
**I don't know why this is the case but I do have a hypothesis. As we can see from the bar chart, ** *Water * **is the most common type. And as we can see from the boxplots above, the correlation between the outcome variable and many predictor variables is quite weak. Therefore, just shooting for the most common type might be the best strategy since the predictors don't provide much information for the outcome.**

### Exercise 9

In the 2020-2021 season, Stephen Curry, an NBA basketball player, made 337 out of 801 three point shot attempts (42.1%). Use bootstrap resampling on a sequence of 337 1’s (makes) and 464 0’s (misses). For each bootstrap sample, compute and save the sample mean (e.g. bootstrap FG% for the player). Use 1000 bootstrap samples to plot a histogram of those values. Compute the 99% bootstrap confidence interval for Stephen Curry’s “true” end-of-season
FG% using the quantile function in R. Print the endpoints of this interval.
